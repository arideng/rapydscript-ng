GlowScript 2.7 VPython
# You need the line above for browser-based vpython

# The simplest possible vpython program:
box(color = vector(1.0, 1.0, 1.0))

# Try changing the color: the components are
#   red, green, blue    each from 0.0 to 1.0

# Then, add a second parameter:   size = vector(2.0, 1.0, 0.1)
#       The order of those three numbers: Length, Height, Width

# Then, a third parameter:  axis = vector(2, 5, 1)
#       The order of those three numbers: x, y, z
